            <p>Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks;<br>
            managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network.<br>
            Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part.<br> 
            Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.</p>

                    <strong> Future of Bitcoin: </strong>
                    Currently, bitcoin is trading around $ 6,300, and its future is an uncertain question. 
                    Investing part of the capital in this cryptocurrency involves taking some risks. 
                    This is due to some of its main characteristics such as its volatility. It is said that bitcoin was 
                    a financial bubble, since most of the people who invested in it did so to earn money. 
                    Investors bought bitcoin, which raised its price without any control. Therefore, it is expected 
                    that with the passage of time the price of bitcoin will continue to decrease, although it may have 
                    its rebound as in all speculation.

            <br>
            The Bitcoin cryptocurrency was created in 2009 by an identity hidden behind the pseudonym 
            of Satoshi Nakamoto. Its initial purpose was the creation of a virtual currency to make purchases
             online. The movement and use of this currency implies a decentralized mechanism, that is, that escapes 
             any type of control of governments, banks or entities related to the financial world.
