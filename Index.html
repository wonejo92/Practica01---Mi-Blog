            Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks;<br>
            managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network.<br>
            Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part.<br> 
            Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.

                <strong> Future of Bitcoin: </strong>
                Currently, bitcoin is trading around $ 6,300, and its future is an uncertain question. 
                Investing part of the capital in this cryptocurrency involves taking some risks. 
                This is due to some of its main characteristics such as its volatility. It is said that bitcoin was 
                a financial bubble, since most of the people who invested in it did so to earn money. 
                Investors bought bitcoin, which raised its price without any control. Therefore, it is expected 
                that with the passage of time the price of bitcoin will continue to decrease, although it may have 
                its rebound as in all speculation.

            Now, new data has suggested the slump in the bitcoin price might be more to do with the "coming of age"
             of bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets–with exciting new competitors distracting investors from the long-time
              crypto poster-boy.</h4>

              Bitcoin, cryptocurrency and financial markets research company Indexica has found that bitcoin’s strongest
                predictive measure was its "quotability," it was first reported by Bloomberg, a financial newswire–meaning 
                traders are treating it like any other investment asset and showing bitcoin is most often being talked about 
                in conjunction with more traditional currencies.</h4>

        <article><h4>"Now that bitcoin is a big kid, anything can make it move, just like anything can make gold or a G-10 currency
            move,” said Zak Selbert, chief executive of Indexica told Bloomberg, adding bitcoin’s sensitivity to new competitors
            such as Facebook's troubled libra project and Mastercard’s partnership with R3 demonstrates the industry's maturity.

                The lightning network is supposed to be bitcoin’s superhero, taking the cryptocurrency to new heights by tackling7
                its toughest and most obvious problem: if cryptocurrency is ever going to “go mainstream,” it needs to support a 
                million times more transactions than it currently does – which is no easy feat.<br>
                <br>
                But by the looks of this graph, lightning appears to be losing momentum. The amount of funds locked up in the 
                layer-two network looks to be decreasing, seeming to indicate that fewer people are using it as a payment method.
                A lightning “channel” is like a gateway to the rest of the network, allowing a user to send a payment to any other
                user.

            The Bitcoin cryptocurrency was created in 2009 by an identity hidden behind the pseudonym 
            of Satoshi Nakamoto. Its initial purpose was the creation of a virtual currency to make purchases
             online. The movement and use of this currency implies a decentralized mechanism, that is, that escapes 
             any type of control of governments, banks or entities related to the financial world.
